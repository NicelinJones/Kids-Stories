                And he bought a more beautiful Diamond with his money.
                He returned back to the India.There was no flight in that days because Aeroplane was not found at that time.
                So he decided to go in ship in sea travel.Travelling in ship take more than one week.
                So He thought if he was showing his talent in ship he can also earn more money so He started to show his talent in ship also.

                Peoples are mesmerized and enjoyed well.
                So he tryed to throw the Diamond more higher on the sky.
                But Suddenly ship shaked and Diamond fell down in the deep sea.
                No one can take it because it was so deep like two mountains deep.

            <h3>The Moral</h3>
            <p>From this story what we learn is ,Drama Artist lose his valuable Diamond in deep sea,like him  we should not lose his soul.
                Because soul is very important for everybody.
                If we do the sin and lose our soul in satan, our life is waste.
                we have to keep the soul with out sin.
                But nothing is impossible by the God.
                we have to get help from the God to keep our soul with out sin by prayers.
                God bless you.
