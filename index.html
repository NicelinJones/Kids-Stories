                So he bought a more beautiful Diamond with his money.
                He returned back to India.There was no flight in those days because Aeroplane was not found yet.
                So he decided to go by the ship for sea travel.Travelling in ship took more than a week.
                He thought,to show his talent in the ship.So he can also earn more money.He started to show his talent in the ship also.

                Then He throwed it up to the sky and catched it.
                It was very beautiful because rainbow colors came out from inside the Diamond.
                Peoples were mesmerized and amazed.
                So he tryed to throw the Diamond more higher to the sky.
                But Suddenly the ship shook and the Diamond fell down into the deep sea.

            <h3>The Moral</h3>
            <p>From this story what we learn is ,Drama Artist lose his valuable Diamond into the deep sea,like him  we should not lose our soul.
                Because our soul is very important for everybody.
                If we do the sin and lose our soul into satan, our life is a waste.
                we have to keep the soul with out sin.
                Unfortunately or unkownly if we do the sin,the only way is Lord jesus.
                He is the one and only God, he who victory the satan.
